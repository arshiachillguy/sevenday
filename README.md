Hello github friends ,
I’m Arshia , a junior Java developer who started this journey less than six months ago. Every day, my excitement to learn and grow in this field increases. 
I’m planning to start a seven-day challenge called "Seven Days, Fourteen Tough Java Questions." Each morning, I’ll post two challenging Java questions for you to ponder over throughout the day. 
By the end of the day, I’ll share the correct answers along with my own solutions. This challenge is aimed at enhancing our Java knowledge.
